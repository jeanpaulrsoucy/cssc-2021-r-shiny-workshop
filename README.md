# What makes R Shiny so shiny? A step-by-step introduction to interactive dashboards in R

## Running the scripts

First, update your packages and install all required packages by running `0_required_packages.R`.

Scripts 1 (`1_download-data.R`) and 2 (`2_process_data.R`) are optional, as the necessary data are already provided in the `data` directory. Only run if you want the latest data from IMDB (note that these are very large files).

Script 3 through 7 are self-contained R Shiny dashboards. Each is more complex than the last.
